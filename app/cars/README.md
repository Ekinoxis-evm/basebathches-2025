# Car Management Module

This directory contains components for managing car NFTs in the application.

## Current Structure

- **cars/page.tsx**: Main dashboard showing user's car NFTs with navigation tabs
- **cars/mint/page.tsx**: Simple NFT minting page
- **cars/tokenize/page.tsx**: Detailed car tokenization with extensive metadata
- **cars/[id]/page.tsx**: Individual car details page
- **cars/trading/page.tsx**: Trading functionality for cars

## Simplification Plan

We're implementing a simplified approach with:

1. **Shared Components**:
   - `CarActionLayout.tsx`: Common layout for all car action pages
   - Future reusable form components

2. **Tabbed Navigation**:
   - Main cars page serves as a hub with tabs for different actions
   - Currently navigates to separate pages, will be consolidated in future

3. **Multi-Step Forms**:
   - Breaking complex forms (tokenization) into manageable steps
   - Improving UX with focused input sections

## Next Steps

- [ ] Refactor tokenize page to use CarActionLayout
- [ ] Convert trading page to use shared components
- [ ] Create reusable form components for car metadata
- [ ] Fully implement tab-based UI in main cars page
- [ ] Add status indicators for NFT minting process

## Design Principles

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Share layouts and components across pages
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show only relevant information at each step
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep business logic separated from UI
- **Responsive Design**: All interfaces work on mobile and desktop
